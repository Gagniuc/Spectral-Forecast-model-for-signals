# Spectral Forecast model for signals

Spectral forecast is a novel general-purpose prediction model recently published in the journal [CHAOS](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5120818). The model revolves around three known states: two extreme outcomes (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>) and one measurement (<i>P</i>). These states are represented by either vectors or matrices that include sets of homologous parameters. An information spectrum is described as a series of predicted states (M1, M2, M3, â€¦, Md) generated between the two extreme outcomes (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>). These states are successively calculated using the [spectral forecast equation](https://github.com/Gagniuc?tab=repositories&q=spectral+forecast&type=&language=&sort=). The predicted states are compared with a known state (<i>P</i>) from the measurements to generate a series of similarity index values. The trend generated by the values of the similarity index shows how a system may behave against these two extreme outcomes (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>). Note that the construction and theory behind the chart of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/Gagniuc/World-smallest-js-chart-v1.0).
